# ml_dataprocessing

the model implements data cleaning and predicts outcomes based on linear regression

1st File contains Basic Linear Regression

2nd File contains Little bit datacleaning with handling na values and convert word to num for processing

3rd File contains implementation of gradient descent algorithm with the help of numpy,math and pandas

4th File contains implementation of OneHotEncoding and LabelEncoding alongside with LinearRegression

5th File contains implementation of training and testing data split

6th File contains implementation of training and testing data split

7th File contains Lots of data cleaning checking and removing for duplicates,null,garbage values implementation of LabelEncoding and OneHotEnoding logic using dummies,
using heatmap feature to find which variables have more significance on our target variable say left column of our employeeretention dataset
plotting a histogram to find the correlation between salary and people leaving
plotting multiple histograms to find correlation between department and people leaving like least people leaving in case of management and randD followed by hr, product,accounting and marketing and then IT,support,technical with most in sales

then implemented logisticregression using two methods first using all parameters
second time using only the parameters having high role as per heatmap generated above
